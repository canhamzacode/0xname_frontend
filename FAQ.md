Advantages of 0xNAMEs:
- 0xNAMEs are built for people by people (BEAST DAO is a decentralised cooperative building public goods in the Web3 space).
- 0xNAMEs are FREE to claim and use forever, because your name, your identity-who you are-is not a product!
- 0xNAMEs are not transferable, not separable from you, just like your name.

### How do I get myself a free personal web3 0xNAME?

Getting your free personal web3 name is easy, just follow the steps:
1️⃣ Visit the dApp [https://app.0xname.foo/](https://app.0xname.foo/)
2️⃣ Search for your desired name and Top Level Name (e.g., john@beast, yulia@eth etc.) using the search bar.
3️⃣ Click the "PROCEED" button, connect your wallet if you haven’t connected it before, and hit “Get now”.
4️⃣ Confirm the transaction in your browser’s wallet extension or your mobile wallet.
5️⃣ Done! Your 0xNAME is ready to use across Web3.

You can have as many 0xNAMEs with various Top Level Names (TLNs) as you need, though just 1 name per 1 TLN is allowed per address.

*Please note: 0xNAME itself is completely free forever! To interact with the blockchain, it will be required to pay the gas fee (determined by the network), so you will need to have some amount of ETH in your wallet.*

---

### How much does it cost to get myself 0xNAME?

It’s FREE. The platform doesn’t charge any one-time or recurring fees.

Digital onchain identity is a right, not a product. Everyone deserves a Web3 name on Ethereum — not just those who can pay for it!
We stand for that and make 0xNAMEs available as a free public good.

*Please note: to interact with a blockchain and to issue your 0xNAME  Soulbound Token to your wallet address, it’s needed to pay transaction fees (also known as gas or network fees). Such transaction fees are connected with any truly decentralised applications or services, and are paid to the actors adding the information (transactions and blocks) to the blockchain.*

---

### Do I need a cryptocurrency wallet to GET 0xNAME?

Yes, to record your 0xNAME on the blockchain and to issue the Soulbound Token, it is needed to have an Ethereum wallet address. You can obtain one with a wallet of your choice.

---

### Do I need a cryptocurrency wallet to USE 0xNAME?

Generally yes: your 0xNAME is connected with your wallet address, and many decentralised applications or services (including the 0xNAME dApp) require connecting your wallet to be able to sign or confirm transactions.

At the same time, it is possible to see any of your 0xNAMEs not connecting the wallet, but using a link: https://app.0xname.foo/n/name@TLN .
Just replace name@TLN with your 0xNAME like, for example [https://app.0xname.foo/n/yulia@beast](https://app.0xname.foo/n/yulia@beast) and you as well as others could access it via the link.

---

### Where can I see my 0xNAME(s)?

Once you’ve got your free 0xNAME, you can anytime view all your 0xNAMEs on the [MY NAMES](https://app.0xname.foo/n/) page on the [app.0xname.foo](https://app.0xname.foo) after connecting your wallet.
It is also possible to see a specific 0xNAME not connecting the wallet, but using a direct link: https://app.0xname.foo/n/name@TLN . Just replace name@TLN with your 0xNAME like [https://app.0xname.foo/n/yulia@beast](https://app.0xname.foo/n/yulia@beast) and you as well as others could see the 0xNAME via the link.
You should also be able to see the 0xNAME Soulbound Token with a graphic representation directly in your wallet under NFTs.

### Why should I get myself 0xNAME(s)?

For web3 users, free personal names are useful in various ways: 
- Easy Transactions:
Using a 0xNAME instead of a long address to receive anything crypto.
*Currently 0xNAMEs resolving functionality needed to receive anything crypto to the name instead of the address is available with MetaMask.
To use it, please install the 0xNAME Resolver Snap via the MetaMask Snap Directory: [https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/0xname-resolver-snap/](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/0xname-resolver-snap/).

- Digital identification:
Various unique names are part of your digital identity.
You can have multiple 0xNAMEs with various Top Level Names (TLNs) like @eth, @ethereum, @beast, @metamask, @gitcoin, @ethdevs and so on to showcase your involvement with some project, DAO or community.

- Access to services or exclusive privileges:
With 0xNAME tokens, you may gain access to various token-gated services or activities and perks provided by some community/project.
For example, people with any 0xNAME can get access to the [Ethereum Sepolia Faucet](https://faucet.0xname.foo/) empowered by 0xNAME and claim some testnet Sepolia ETH. The other example is that BEAST DAO members, holding 0xNAME@beast are eligible to vote on various internal decisions and so on.

- Communications:
0xNAMEs could be used across various social media for building trust & recognition.
For example, on Bluesky you can use any of your 0xNAMEs as your handle to self-verify your identity like, for example, [https://bsky.app/profile/yulia.eth.0xname.foo](https://bsky.app/profile/yulia.eth.0xname.foo). This is currently done manually on a case by case basis, please reach out to us via our [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/beastdao.org) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/McqF7vyCWx) for further assistance.

More ways to use your 0xNAME will emerge with the adoption of the names.

### Can I sell or transfer my 0xNAME(s)?

No, your 0xNAME is issued as a non-transferable (Soulbound) token directly to your wallet address. It is not possible to transfer or sell it.

If you need to transfer the 0xNAME you own to another wallet of yours, you should firstly “Delete” your 0xNAME on the [“MY NAMES”](https://app.0xname.foo/n/) page, using the same wallet, which was used to issue the name, and then issue a new 0xNAME using another wallet address.
